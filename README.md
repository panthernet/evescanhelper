# EVE Online Scan Helper Utility

This tiny tool is designed to store scan signatures for all visited systems with the ability to let you know if there are new signatures present in a system. Even with the EVE ability to remember scanned sigs between system jumps this tool still can save you a lot of time. You will have all the sigs at hand even after a downtime.

Feel free to leave suggestions on the [Issues page](https://github.com/panthernet/evescanhelper/issues) and visit our [Discord channel #scanhelper](https://discord.gg/UsnY6UR) for a live support chat.
